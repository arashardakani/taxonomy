# Verilog Code Generation

This dataset teaches the model to generate **Verilog HDL** code for common digital logic circuits.

It includes examples for:
- Multiplexers
- Adders
- Flip-flops
- Counters
- Simple FSMs

Each example pairs a user prompt with a precise Verilog implementation.
The goal is to help the model produce correct, synthesizable Verilog modules.
